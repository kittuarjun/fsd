    <h2>Auguries of Innocence</h2>
    <p>
     The possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is debated by researchers,<br>
      but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.<br>
      A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; <br>
       better.

        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus
        gallus),originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and has become
        one of the most common and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their
        meat and eggs, though they are also kept as pets.[1]
    </p>
    <p>
        As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced
        annually for consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and
        egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social
        animals with complex vocalizations and behaviors, and feature prominently in folklore, religion, and literature
        across many societies. Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry and
        agriculture.

    <h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipson dolor,To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle
        dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[36] The dance triggers a response in the hen[36]
        and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically
        involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is
        unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back.
        After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.<sup><a href="somsesource.com">[37]</a></sup>
        Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in an action called the 'cloacal
        kiss'.[38] As with all birds, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system,[39] the
        Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus. Reproductive hormones including estrogen,
        progesterone, and gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain
        sexual maturation changes. Reproduction declines with age, thought to be due to a decline in GnRH-I-N.[40] </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3><b>Phylogeny</b></h3>
    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
        them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched
        chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow
        much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a
        heritage chicken of the same age.[22]
        Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of
        skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds
        have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[23]
        Chickens are omnivores.[24] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as
        large as lizards, small snakes,[25] and young mice.[26] A chicken may live for 5â€“10 years, depending on the
        breed.[27] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[28]
        Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens
        dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest
        sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif
        Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[29][30] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in
        conflicts.[31] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young
        fox.[32] Chickens have been thought of primarily as providers of food, but their cognition, emotions, and
        sociality are comparable with other birds and mammals.[33]

        Crowing (with audio)
        A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,[34] and in
        response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call
        their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or
        on the ground.[35]</p>
